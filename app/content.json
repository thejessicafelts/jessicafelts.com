  "mission": {
    "title": "I once built a website...",
    "copy": {
      "p1": "My name is Jessica Felts, and I grew up in a very small town, in a very rural part of Northern Michigan. I am front-end web developer, based in the Metro Detroit area, who has a passion for beautifully designed, user-friendly websited, developed with best practices in mind. As you'll see below, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP; and have experience in web design, and eCommerce development.",
      "p2": "My professional journey started in 2014, when I snagged an internship with eCommerce consulting giant Lyons Consulting Group. There, I served as an Applications Engineer intern, and worked with various high-level clients, completing significant work in the areas of front-end development, and content management, using the Demandware Business Manager.",
      "p3": "I left Lyons Consulting Group in 2016, and began working full time as a Digital Solutions Consultant, with a small group of clients, focusing on webinar design, development, and maintenance. My belief is that having a strong and effective online presence is key to the success of any modern company or professional individual, and I strived to provide that for my clients.",
      "p4": "In 2017, I re-entered the agency world to accept a position at Royal Oak-based iwerk, as a Software Developer, specializing in WordPress development. There, I built out the front-end experience of a custom intranet for global advertising agency Jack Morton, completely from scratch. After completing this project, I left iwerk, and joined the team at Organic - where I remain currently, working exclusively on various projects for Wells Fargo. Since starting with Organic, I have spearheaded the development efforts for three different websites, and serve as lead developer on a fourth. I also commonly work in tandem with other developers on my team, to support them in their development efforts.",
      "p5": "Developing (and even designing) web experiences is something I am very passionate about. In this day and age, everything is so digitally focused, that if you or your business don't have a website, you practically cease to exist - or at the very least, appear to lack credibility. I love keeping up with the latest and greatest our industry has to offer, and I am committed to creating the best web experiences I can, each and every time I am tasked with a project. I look forward to what the future has to offer me, and can't wait to see where this crazy industry takes me."
